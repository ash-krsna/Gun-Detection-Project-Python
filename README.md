# Gun-Detection-Project-Python
Real-time Gun Detection System using Python and OpenCV. This project accesses a live camera feed to detect guns using computer vision and object detection techniques. It processes video frames in real time, draws bounding boxes on detected weapons, and can be extended for surveillance and public safety applications.
